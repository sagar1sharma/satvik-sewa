          Hello! This app is made to diagnose if you have some form of any
          mental illness, but more than diagnose, it is meant to make people
          more aware of mental illnesses. As awareness of mental illness is
          already increasing in the world, still there is a lot of resistance
          regarding getting checked by a psychiatrist. That's exactly where this
          app steps in to help! Questionnaire is prepared with the help of
          doctors and gradually takes a decision. Users are advised to be as
          accurate as possible to get as accurate result as possible.
